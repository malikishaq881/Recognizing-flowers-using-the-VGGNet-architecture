# Recognizing-flowers-using-the-VGGNet-architecture
Utilizing the VGGNet architecture with data augmentation for flower recognition involves enhancing a flower image dataset with techniques like rotation and scaling, then fine-tuning a pre-trained VGGNet model for the specific task. This approach improves the model's ability to accurately classify different types of flowers in images.
